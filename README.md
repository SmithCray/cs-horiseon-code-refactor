### {Horiseon code refactor project}

<br>

## Our Mission:

Here at Horiseon we strive to be the best in Search Engine Optimization,
Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing! Bring your
designs into the 21st century with style and efficiency working hand-in-hand to provide the best web experience for your consumers.

<br>

## The Task:

We have been hired too optimize and refactor Horiseon's webpage and code for an upcomming product launch that is expected to increase their userbase and create more travel on their site. In addition we will be replacing non-semantic code with semantic-elements to make the database cleaner, easier to read, and easier to edit in the future. At the end of this project our goal is to present a BETTER experience for Horiseon's growing userbase though a stream lined wedpage with a familiar look we all know and love.
